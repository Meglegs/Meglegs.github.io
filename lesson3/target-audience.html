                    Lucia is planning to taking some pictures for her instgram later on in the day and 
                she wants some inspiration on how she should do her hair. She goes to Tangls and not only 
                has inspiration for hairstyle but gets appropriate styles for the weather that day!

                    <br><br>Margo is going on a date! She doesn't know where he's taking her but she wants to be prepared
                    for anything, especially a hustery blustery day, so she checks out Tangls!
                <br><br>Topenga has the curliest hair and struggles to keep it under wraps in the weather so she turns to Tangls! to help her 
                        get tips on how to maintain curls in the humidity.

                <br><br>Corey is a California girl, and is not taking these harsh Rexburg winters very well. If she didn't check out Tangls!
                        she might have never found a product to help her address her dry itchy scalp. 

                <br><br>Demi is a travel enthusiast, she recently heard about Tangls! and is now able to plan for her hair care essentials 
                        well before leaving for a new trip. She loves Tangls!
